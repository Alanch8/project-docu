### Pre-commit Hook

To create a pre-commit hook and avoid unnecessary commits in the Main branch. Use the following pre-commit.sh file and save it in the .git/hooks/ folder of the project.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Alanch8/841aaad9de838330a8b7923d3c773c24.js"></script>

First of all, run the following command to give administrator permissions to the file.

I think a good practice can be to create a script in the package.json file with the necessary command line and run it after the first commit.
